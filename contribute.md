# Phylogenetic Study Curator
[https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator)
is our curation application.


You can contribute to the synthetic tree by uploading trees 
    through our curation interface.
These can be trees from TreeBASE or trees uploaded from your computer.

There will be a delay before uploaded trees appear in the
  synthetic tree.

There are detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/opentree/wiki/Submitting-phylogenies-to-Open-Tree-of-Life) on how to use
the curation application.
