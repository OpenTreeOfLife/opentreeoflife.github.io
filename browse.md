# Tree Browser

[https://tree.opentreeoflife.org](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org)
is our interactive tree viewer.
You can browse by  the synthetic tree and leave feedback.

### Navigation

Click on nodes to move through the tree.
If you click the "Legend" button at the top, you will get an explanation
    of what information the visual elements of the tree convey.

### Seeing more info about a node

You can reveal the "Properties panel" by clicking on "**ⓘ** Show Properties"
    button or the "**ⓘ**" link that appears when your mouse is over a node or 
    branch in the tree.

The properities panel contains:

  * links to the taxon in our reference taxonomy (OTT) and other taxonomies
  * the ID of the node
  * the count of how many tips in the tree descend from the node
  * information about how to download a Newick representation of the subtree
      rooted at that node, and
  * information about taxonomies and phylogenies that support or disagree with
    that node.

Clicking on "**ⓘ** Hide Properties" will hide the panel so that you can see more 
    of the tree.

### Feedback

If you have feedback about the relationships that you see, use the "Add Comment" button.
Comments that are entered here are stored as issues in our
[feedback repository](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/feedback/issues).


# Taxonomy Browser

[https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/taxonomy/browse](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/taxonomy/browse?id=93302) is our browser for the Open Tree Taxonomy.
That taxonomy is an input into our full synthetic tree and 
is used to help us align tips in different trees that refer to the same taxon.
