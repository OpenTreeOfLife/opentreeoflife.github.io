# Tree Browser

[https://tree.opentreeoflife.org](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org)
is our interactive tree viewer.
You can browse by  the synthetic tree and leave feedback.

## Navigation

Click on nodes to move through the tree.
If you click the "Legend" button at the top, you will get an explanation
    of what information the visual elements of the tree convey.

## Seeing more info

You can reveal an "Properties panel" by clicking on "ⓘ Show Properties"
    button or the "ⓘ" link that appears when your mouse is over a node or 
    branch in the tree.
The properities panel contains:
  * links to the taxon in our reference taxonomy (OTT) and other taxonomies
  * the ID of the node
  * the count of how many tips in the tree descend from the node
  * information about how to download a Newick representation of the subtree
      rooted at that node, and
  * information about taxonomies and phylogenies that support or disagree with
    that node.

Clicking on "ⓘ Hide Properties" will hide the panel so that you can see more 
    of the tree.

## Feedack

If you have feedback about the relationships that you see, use the "Add Comment" button.
