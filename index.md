# Open Tree of Life

Open Tree of Life aims to construct a comprehensive, dynamic and digitally-available tree of life by synthesizing published phylogenetic trees along with taxonomic data.

* [Browse the synthetic tree and leave feedback](http://tree.opentreeoflife.org)
  Click on nodes to move through the tree, and click on nodes or edges to see more information about taxonomies
  and phylogenies that contain / support that node. If you have feedback about the relationships that you see, use the "Add Comment" button.

* [Contribute and curate data:](http://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator)
  You can contribute to the synthetic tree by uploading trees through our curation interface. These can be trees
  from TreeBASE or trees uploaded from your computer. There will be a delay before uploaded trees appear in the
  synthetic tree. Up to summer 2015, the release cycle has been months between new versions of the synthetic tree,
  but this should shorten in the future. 

* [Browse the OpenTree Taxonomy (OTT):](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/taxonomy/browse?id=93302)
  Interactive exploration of the current taxonomy used by OpenTree.

* *Interact with OpenTree data*: 
  * R interface: [ROTL](https://github.com/ropensci/rotl)
