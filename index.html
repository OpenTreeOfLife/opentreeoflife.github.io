<p>Open Tree of Life aims to construct a comprehensive, dynamic and digitally-available tree of life by synthesizing published phylogenetic trees along with taxonomic data.</p>

<a href="browse" class="boxlink"><div>
<p>
    <img width="50%" height="50%" src="images/tree-browse-screenshot.png" align="left" hspace="2" /> Browse the synthetic tree and taxonomy.
    You can get information about the source of the information and provide feedback.

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tree.opentreeoflife.org">Browse the synthetic tree or our taxonomy and leave feedback</a>
  Click on nodes to move through the tree, and click on nodes or edges to see more information about taxonomies
  and phylogenies that contain / support that node. If you have feedback about the relationships that you see, use the "Add Comment" button.</li>
 <li><a href="http://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator">Contribute and curate data:</a>
  You can contribute to the synthetic tree by uploading trees through our curation interface. These can be trees
  from TreeBASE or trees uploaded from your computer. There will be a delay before uploaded trees appear in the
  synthetic tree. </li>
